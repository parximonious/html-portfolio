    <h1>Carlos Jimenez</h1>
    <p><em>Learner of <strong>Things</strong></em></p>
    <p>I am a truck driver who just can't shake the feeling that I should learn how to code. So I started this Web Developer course because I think I should learn the basics of coding. 
        Maybe I'm wrong and dont need to know HTML, but I'm already here.</p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jardin de Ninos - Moroleon, GTO, Mexico
            <ul> <li>This was the kindergarten that was on the second floor at the Mercado.</li> 
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Escuela Primaria Francisco I. Madero - Moroleon, GTO, Mexico
            <ul><li>This was my first real school. Made some friends, and was good at getting good grades.</li> 
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.d300.org/LWS">Lakewood Middle School</a> - Carpentersville, IL</li>
            <ul><li>After we moved to the US this was the first school I attended. It was a bilingual school so learning English was slow, even though it was a main focus. Immersion is the best way to learn</li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.basd.k12.wi.us/schools/dyer/">Dyer Elementary School</a> - Burlington, WI</li>
            <ul><li>This is where I really learned English. Teachers didn't speak Spanish. There was nobody to hold my hand, full immersion. Even the Spanish teacher couldn't converse. Sink or swim.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.basd.k12.wi.us/schools/karcher/">Karcher Middle School</a> - Burlington, WI</li>
            <ul><li>I learned English so well in my one year at Dyer that my Karcher teachers didn't know I had just learned it and treated me like any other student. It was hard and that fact didn't click at first. I was still expecting special treatment and it didn't come.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.basd.k12.wi.us/schools/high/">Burlington High School</a> - Burlington, WI</li>
            <ul><li>Just your regular old high school. I was still getting good grades but felt like an outsider. I felt like I didn't know anyone because most kids had grown up together and I just kinda showed up. </li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.gtc.edu/">Gateway Technical College</a> -  Elkhorn/Kenosha, WI</li>
            <ul><li>I took a one year course in Automotive Maintenace so I could learn how to fix my own crappy cars. I had no desire to get hired by a dealer to fix cars all day.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a href="https://uwm.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a> - Milwaukee, WI</li>
            <ul><li>This was my first crack at computer science and it didn't go well. I did however learned that if I focused and applied myself I could get physically healthier and lose a lot of weight.</li>
            </ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.procdl.net/">Pro CDL Driving School</a> - Milwaukee, WI</li>
            <ul><li>While I was working at Lavelle I finally listened to my dad and got my CDL. It took a while to pay off but I'm finally putting the $3K I invested to work.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
